# codespace-sandbox

Codespace sandbox for interviews. Setup and placeholders for three languages: C/C++, JavaScript, and Python.

## C/C++

C/C++ support is provided by GCC/G++. The "setup.sh" script ensures these are installed and updated for the VM system package configuration. The "main.cpp" file will compile out of the box:

```
  $ g++ main.cpp
  $ ./a.out
  Hello, world!
```

## JavaScript

JavaScript support is provided by NodeJS. The "setup.sh" script ensures this environment is installed and updated for the VM system package configuration. The "main.js" file will run out of the box::

```
  $ node main.js
  Hello, world!
```

## Python

Python support is provided by Python3. The "setup.sh" script ensures this environment is installed and updated for the VM system package configuration. The "main.py" file will run out of the box::

```
  $ python3 main.py
  Hello, world!
```
